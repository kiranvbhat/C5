 My worst ideas.

`bogosort.py`

A variety of terrible sorting algorithms.

`seppuku.py`

A file that deletes itself, with a dramatic reading of General Akashi Gidayū’s Death Poem.

`verbosify.py`

A program that makes your sentences more verbose (by replacing every word with it's longest synonym).

`wordle/wordle.py`

A command-line Wordle clone, but you can choose the length of the randomly-selected word. Have fun trying to guess the 17-letter wordle.
